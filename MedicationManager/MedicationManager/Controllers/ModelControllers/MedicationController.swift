/* NOTE
 Lazy in swift
 When a property is only needed at some point in time, you can prefix it with the lazy keyword so it'll be "excluded" from the initialization process and it's default value will be assigned on-demand. This can be useful for types that are expensive to create, or needs more time to be created. Here is a quick tale of a lazy princess. ðŸ‘¸ðŸ’¤

 ______________________________________________________________________________________
 Private in swift
 The private keyword is used a lot more and restricts the use of an entity to the enclosing declaration and its extensions. The extensions, however, have to be defined within the same file. In other words, private declarations will not be visible outside the file. You can use this keyword to only expose the minimal code needed to interact with the entity. This will improve readability and makes it easier to use and understand your code for others.
